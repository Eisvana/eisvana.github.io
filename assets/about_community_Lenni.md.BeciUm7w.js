This means I documented the things I found on the wiki. This included systems, planets, fauna, starships, MTs, etc.</p><p>Nowadays, I don&#39;t play the game as much anymore, because I have a lot of other &quot;jobs&quot; in the NMS universe. For example I am a wiki admin. As such, I spend most of my time on the wiki, patrolling new edits.</p><p>I also discovered my love for programming through the wiki. I built a wiki page creator, which can generate wiki code from a few inputs, simplifying the process. From this learning experience, I went on to build other web apps and websites, such as this one.</p><p>With my NMS modding experience, I also built some datamining and save editing web apps.</p><p>When I actually play the game (meaning I am not testing mods or verifying stuff for the wiki), I try to learn all the languages, level up my frigates, gain standing with the various factions, or just do missions and hunt pirates.</p><h2 id="departments" tabindex="-1">Departments <a class="header-anchor" href="#departments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Departments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;m the Head Scholar, and also have the Director position in the Bridge Crew.
