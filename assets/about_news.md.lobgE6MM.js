The idea is to split each department and other sections of Eisvana into smaller chunks, which can then be overseen by one or potentially multiple people. Multiple of these smaller chunks are then combined into one bigger department, which is in turn overseen by one Bridge member. Everyone who has been an active citizen for at least three months can apply for the manager position.</p><h2 id="pristine-planet-hunt-2-january-2024" tabindex="-1">Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024) <a class="header-anchor" href="#pristine-planet-hunt-2-january-2024" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A paradise planet is wanted for a new EBC project with the working title &quot;Special Art Gallery&quot;.
