# About

Eisvana is a civilized space community in the Eissentam galaxy.

## Philosophy

In Eisvana, we believe in freedom. Freedom to choose our own path, to express our own thoughts, to pursue our own happiness. Freedom is not just a word, but a way of life. We value the diversity and creativity of our people, who are free to explore their potential and contribute to the common good. We respect the rights and dignity of every individual, and we defend them from any oppression or injustice. Freedom is our philosophy, and our pride.
