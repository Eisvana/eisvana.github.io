# Greetings Eisvana, from Yuca!

So, this is it! Our blog is live! Let's try it out!
It's funny thatr this coincindes with the launch of the Orbital update... So all my ship hunting is now... threatened? Transformed? Useless? Enhanced? I am downloading the update at the moment so I will have to figure it out myself.
New space stations is exciting. My photo button will probably break from excessive use.
Let's be honest. I have already about 18,000 pictures taken in Eisvana. I guess I like the photographic side of NMS, right?
Download complete! See you soon!
