# Naming Guidelines

## Pattern

All star systems in Eisvana space must have a unique prefix that follows this pattern: `EV<region number>-<system ID> <system name>`.

### Parts

- **region number**: The number that was assigned to a specific region. Can be found in the [region table](./joining#regions).
- **system ID**: Corresponds to the last part of the signal booster, omitting the leading zeros.
- **system name**: Can be chosen freely, as long as no offensive names are used. Using the procedural name is fine as well.

## Example

The prefix for the system at the coordinates `0FFE:0021:0910:010A` would be `EV1-10A`. So the complete name could look like this: `EV1-10A Narnia`.

## Notes

If you are not sure whether you are doing it correctly, ask in the [Eisvana Discord server](https://discord.gg/Czu3VvjBaa).

::: danger
**Do not** alt-tab out of the game while renaming a system. It will instantly apply the name once you tab back into the game.
