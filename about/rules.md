# Rules

To ensure that playing in Eisvana is as enjoyable as possible, we ask that you follow a few basic rules.

## PvP

- No non-consensual PvP in our space.
  - For consensual PvP, please go to an uninhabited system, so people don't get in the crossfire.
- Turning off PvP in the settings is recommended.

## Building

- Don't build next to portals.
- Keep your distance to the next base to minimise lag (10 walking minutes are recommended).

## Discoveries

- Do **not** use the "Upload All" button.
- If you discovered a system and want to upload it, apply our [System Naming Guidelines](./naming).
