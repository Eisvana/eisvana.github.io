# Medals

Medals are our way to award our citizens when they participate in Eisvana.

For example "Found a GMB", "Organised an event", "Created x amount of wiki pages", etc.

They are not fully finished yet, we are mainly missing images for them. If you want to help with that, go to the [Medals thread](https://discord.com/channels/812176491617976330/1183152058824667248) in the participation board in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Czu3VvjBaa).
