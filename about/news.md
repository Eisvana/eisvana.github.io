## Eisvana's First Anniversary (18 September 2024)

Eisvana turns one year old today! We have achieved a lot in the past year. We discovered all our star systems, started several building projects and colonies, made our own web apps, added more ways for our citizens to contribute, the list goes on. And we also managed to become one of the biggest civilizations in Eissentam within this year, with over 50 registered citizens! Eisvana stands for community involvement. All these achievements wouldn't have been possible without our awesome community! Thanks to everyone who's part of Eisvana! There are still a lot of ideas floating around, probably enough to fill the next 10 years! Onto a successful second year!

## New Capital Planet (18 September 2024)

The Worlds Part I update turned our old capital planet Accordia into a purple swamp. After a lot of searching, we voted on a new capital planet: [New Accordia](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/New_Accordia)! The planet can be found at this address: <span class="glyphs">406CA21107FF</span>

## Embassy Planet (18 September 2024)

Eisvana now has an official embassy planet: [Avalonis](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Avalonis). Ambassadors from other civilizations and communities are encouraged to build their embassy on this planet or in the surrounding region "Imnito", which acts as our embassy region.

The planet took the second place in the capital planet vote. To not leave it unused, we decided to turn it into our embassy planet.

## Themed Regions (18 September 2024)

In order to better tie our lore and regions together, we are introducing regional themes! Each region also has a regional centre system that hosts something special related to the region's theme. We're starting with three regions, but it's planned to expand this to the other regions as well.

The themes do not strictly dictate what happens in a specific region, but rather set a rough guideline for worldbuilding purposes. So for example, if we declare a region as a "farming" region, farms can still be built outside of that region, and bases that aren't farms can also still be built in that region. But if you want to build a farm and don't know where, this might be a good guidance to narrow down the location.

| Region   | Theme   | Theme Description                           | Regional Centre                                                    |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flinus   | Lore    | Lore-relevant builds (Beetle shrines, etc.) | EV1-10 Dabri                                                       |
| Imnito   | Embassy | Other civilizations' embassies              | [EV2-5D Veridia](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/EV2-5D_Veridia) |
| Cuynteto | Capital | Most populated region                       | [EV5-6C Clarity](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/EV5-6C_Clarity) |

## Atlas App (18 September 2024)

All star systems in Eisvana are discovered since 22 July 2024. To get a better overview over how much and what has been discovered where, when and by whom, we made a new web app: The [Atlas App](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Discovery-Data).
It lists all star systems, planets, creatures, minerals, plants, settlements and bases, as well as their discoverer and the discovery date. The data can also be filtered.
And on top of that, it also shows detailed statistics and charts made from this data. For example who discovered the most, when have the most discoveries been made, or how successful we are at properly renaming systems.
The data will be continuously updated.

## Census Management Tool (17 April 2024)

Our new [Census Management Tool](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Census) is now live. It is probably _the_ most advanced census tool in all of civilized space, allowing for applications, updates and renewals all from within one app, and without the user ever having to directly interact with the wiki. And the best part: It's fully open source, so other civs can use it as well if they want to. The data for all citizens is queried from the wiki API. The forms are submitted to Discord as a text file, which can directly be copy-pasted into the wiki.

## Eisvana Website Launches (27 March 2024)

We have moved our most important documentation and forms to our own website. This streamlines processes like applications and feedback, and makes us independent from big companies like Google (all Google forms that were used in the past are now deprecated and have been moved to our own form system).

The website should be a place to easily find info regarding Eisvana, and to quickly navigate to our various apps.

## New Leadership Role: Managers (2 January 2024)

To add another layer of leadership below the Bridge Crew, the "Manager" position is created. The idea is to split each department and other sections of Eisvana into smaller chunks, which can then be overseen by one or potentially multiple people.
Multiple of these smaller chunks are then combined into one bigger department, which is in turn overseen by one Bridge member. Everyone who has been an active citizen for at least three months can apply for the manager position.

## Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024)

A paradise planet is wanted for a new EBC project with the working title "Special Art Gallery". The planet should have no storms, no heavy cloud cover and no atmospheric filters, meaning colours are represented as accurately as possible.

## Census Reset (1 January 2024)

As every year, the census resets on the first of January. This year, we are using a new the [Eisvana Census Renew](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Census/renew.html) web app to give our citizens the possibility to renew their census entries.

## Eisvana Reaches Double Hub-Status (11 December 2023)

In addition to the 20 bases, there are now also 20 people with two types of ID on the census. This means a gold starburst is added to our embassy wiki page, and the size updated to HUB-R. Only few civs have achieved this size, so we are very proud of everyone who is part of Eisvana!

## Eisvana Reaches Hub-Size (9 December 2023)

20 Bases have been documented in Eisvana, meaning Eisvana is now officially marked as HUB-B on the wiki and has a silver starburst.

## Participation Board Is Created (9 December 2023)

Since the participation forum worked very well in the early days of the civ, we are bringing it back in the form of the participation board. Everyone can post projects there, and whoever is interested can participate. It's also the place to post suggestions for the Discord server and the civ as a whole.

## Eisvana Is Officially Recognised on the Wiki as a Civilized Space (5 November 2023)

The capital planet and logo were the last requirements for being recognised.

## Eisvana's Logo Is Finalised (4 November 2023)

With the new capital planet, we can now also finalise our logo. On the top half is now a very faint Atlas orb in the background, to keep the best of both worlds of the initially suggested logos.

## Eisvana's Capital Planet (4 November 2023)

After a lot of searching, Eisvana now has a capital planet: [Accordia](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Accordia) in the EV5-5E Cadence system. The system name is a reference to the civ name vote back in September, where "The Cadence" scored second place. Since many people clearly liked the name, it was chosen for the capital system. All five candidates were showcased in their own video, all of which can be found in this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzaVLTk2PZzmkTPbt8fariZMkcshuSLPu&si=KuDpIddtrZ-kGERh).

## Halloween Event Planet Is Announced (16 October 2023)

Infested planet [Itwood](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Itwood), featuring an underground lesser mushroom beetle, has won the vote!

## New Eisvana Fauna Albums (15 October 2023)

Due to community demand, we have two new fauna albums:

- [Eisvana Common Fauna Album](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Eisvana_Common_Fauna_Album)
- [Eisvana Mechanoceris Album](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Eisvana_Mechanoceris_Album)

## Halloween Event Hunt (7 October 2023)

A hunt is started for a planet for a halloween colony. The planet should have heavy filter effects, scary monsters, or super creepy flora. Any biome is good if it fits the vibe though!

## Eisvana's Wiki Apps Go Live (3 October 2023)

After lots of testing, the [Eisvana Wiki Page Creator](https://lenni009.github.io/EisvanaWikiPageCreator/) and the [Eisvana Album Entry App](https://lenni009.github.io/Eisvana-Album-Entry/) go live to assist with wiki documentation.

## Eisvana's Logo (3 October 2023)

Thanks to Nicki, Eisvana has a logo now. It is only semi-official, until we find a capital planet, which will then be put in the final logo. The logo was voted on by the community and won 20 - 7 against a similar logo featuring the atlas orb in the background.

## Eisvana's Census Is Started (26 September 2023)

The [census](/services/census) is also started, since there are now regions in which we can settle.

## Capital Planet Hunt Begins (26 September 2023)

## Eisvana's Regions Are Announced (26 September 2023)

Eisvana's 7 regions are announced, along with their coordinates and naming guidelines that the community decided on.

## Capital Region Hunt (21 September 2023)

The hunt for the capital region begins after the requirements have been set:

- In Eissentam
- In the fade
- Preferrably in the delta quadrant
- Should have as many "purely-named" regions next to each other

## New Name: Eisvana (20 September 2023)

With 14 votes, "Eisvana" has won in a very close race against 6 other name candidates. The name was voted on by the community.

## The Civ Is Founded (18 September 2023)

After a hefty disagreement and a lot of drama, a new civ is founded. It doesn't have a name, logo or region in space yet, but the community is actively working on building the civ.
