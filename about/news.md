## Leadership Structure Expanded (2 January 2024)

To add another layer of leadership below the Bridge Crew, the "Manager" position is created. The idea is to split each department and other sections of Eisvana into smaller chunks, which can then be overseen by one or potentially multiple people.
Multiple of these smaller chunks are then combined into one bigger department, which is in turn overseen by one Bridge member. Everyone who has been an active citizen for at least three months can apply for the manager position.

## Pristine Planet Hunt (2 January 2024)

A paradise planet is wanted for a new EBC project with the working title "Special Art Gallery". The planet should have no storms, no heavy cloud cover and no atmospheric filters, meaning colours are represented as accurately as possible.

## Census Reset (1 January 2024)

As every year, the census resets on the first of January. This year, we are using a new the [Eisvana Census Renew](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Census-Renew/) web app to give people the possibility to renew their census entries.

## Eisvana Reaches Double Hub-Status (11 December 2023)

In addition to the 20 bases, there are now also 20 people with two types of ID on the census. This means a gold starburst is added to our embassy wiki page, and the size updated to HUB-R. Only few civs have achieved this size, so we are very proud of everyone who is part of Eisvana!

## Eisvana Reaches Hub-Size (9 December 2023)

20 Bases have been documented in Eisvana, meaning Eisvana is now officially marked as HUB-B on the wiki and has a silver starburst.

## Participation Board Is Created (9 December 2023)

Since the participation forum worked very well in the early days of the civ, we are bringing it back in the form of the participation board. Everyone can post projects there, and whoever is interested can participate. It's also the place to post suggestions for the Discord server and the civ as a whole.

## Eisvana Is Officially Recognised on the Wiki as a Civilized Space (5 November 2023)

The capital planet and logo were the last requirements for being recognised.

## Eisvana's Logo Is Finalised (4 November 2023)

With the new capital planet, we can now also finalise our logo. On the top half is now a very faint Atlas orb in the background, to keep the best of both worlds of the initially suggested logos.

## Eisvana's Capital Planet (4 November 2023)

After a lot of searching, Eisvana now has a capital planet: [Accordia](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Accordia) in the EV5-5E Cadence system. The system name is a reference to the civ name vote back in September, where "The Cadence" scored second place. Since many people clearly liked the name, it was chosen for the capital system. All five candidates were showcased in their own video, all of which can be found in this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzaVLTk2PZzmkTPbt8fariZMkcshuSLPu&si=KuDpIddtrZ-kGERh).

## Halloween Event Planet Is Announced (16 October 2023)

## Halloween Event Hunt (7 October 2023)

A hunt is started for a planet for a halloween colony. The planet should have heavy filter effects, scary monsters, or super creepy flora. Any biome is good if it fits the vibe though!

## Eisvana's Wiki Apps Go Live (3 October 2023)

After lots of testing, the [Eisvana Wiki Page Creator](https://lenni009.github.io/EisvanaWikiPageCreator/) and the [Eisvana Album Entry App](https://lenni009.github.io/Eisvana-Album-Entry/) go live to assist with wiki documentation.

## Eisvana's Logo (3 October 2023)

Thanks to Nicki, Eisvana has a logo. It is only semi-official, until we find a capital planet, which will then be put in the final logo. The logo was voted on by the community and won 20 - 7 against a similar logo featuring the atlas orb in the background.

## The Civ Now Has a Name: Eisvana (20 September 2023)

## The Civ Is Founded (18 September 2023)

After a hefty disagreement and a lot of drama, Eisvana is founded. It doesn't have a name, logo or region in space yet, but the community is actively working on building the civ.
