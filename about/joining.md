# How to Join

## Reach Eisvana

Eisvana is located at the edge of Eissentam, the 10th galaxy.

Before you attempt getting here, make sure you are in Eissentam. If you are not yet in Eissentam, you can look at the featured bases in the teleporter in the anomaly. Often there is a base in Eissentam that you can teleport to.

## Build a Base

Build a base anywhere in our space and upload it.

Most people build on the capital planet, but you can build anywhere you want.

Please respect our [rules](./rules) for bases.

## Fill out the Census

When you have built and uploaded your base, you are ready to fill out our [census form](https://forms.gle/A85N3NkYXkM5XXjx5).

## Share Your Base on Discord

As the final step, take a picture of your base and send it into the **#eisvana-bases-farms** channel in our Discord server. Your census entry cannot be created without a picture of the base.

## After becoming a Citizen

When you are a citizen, you can join one of our [departments](./departments), or create your own and become a manager.
