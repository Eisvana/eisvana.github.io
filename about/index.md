# About

Eisvana serves as both a spatial realm within No Man's Sky, as well as the collective name for a civilized space community of players who engage in "living and exploring" within this expanse.

You can join us in Eisvana and explore at your own pace. Whether you want to take snapshots of your adventures, record your discoveries, or simply enjoy the scenery, you are welcome to do so.

We look forward to encountering you amidst the stars!

## Mission

Our mission is to explore and document our regions of space. We want to offer players the opportunity to meet others, visit bases, share discoveries, and more. Eisvana should be a safe and inclusive space where people can come together.

## Philosophy

In Eisvana, we believe in freedom. Freedom to choose our own path, to express our own thoughts, to pursue our own happiness. We value the diversity and creativity of our people, who are free to explore their potential and contribute to the common good. We respect the rights and dignity of every individual, and we defend them from any oppression or injustice. Freedom is our philosophy, and our pride.

## Lore

Eisvana features extensive lore that's open to contribution from everyone.

The lore is split up into multiple topics, like the Origins of Eisvana, Cosmic Tales, or our Worship of the Mushroom Beetles.

You can find our full lore on the [Eisvana Lore](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Eisvana_Lore) wiki page.
