Eisvana officially occupies the following 7 regions:

<!--@include: ../parts/regionTable.md-->

You can press <img :class="keys.image" src="/icons/KEY.R.png" width="18" />/<img :class="keys.image" src="/icons/PSBUTTON.TRIANGLE.png" width="23" />/<img :class="keys.image" src="/icons/XBOXBUTTON.A.png" width="23" /> (PC/PS/XB) in the Galactic Map to extend the system infopanel. It will tell you the current region.

There is no clear visible border of Eisvana space. You have to go by the region name to make sure you stay within the regions. However, as you explore our space, you will gradually get a sense of its boundaries.

## What are System Prefixes?

System prefixes are used to mark a system as claimed by Eisvana. It also serves as a way to give exact location information of a system in a short form that can be used inside a system name. See [naming guidelines](./naming) or watch this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/NVvuGCMsKGg) for how to use them.

The naming guidelines are **mandatory** within our 7 regions. Players who don't wish to follow the naming guidelines should not upload systems in Eisvana.

If you are not sure if you are doing it correctly, ask a Mentor in the Eisvana Discord. Once a system is renamed, it cannot be changed again, so better double check than making a mistake.

You can use the [Eisvana System Naming Tools](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-System-Naming-Tools/) to generate the prefix for your current system, and also to practice the naming.

## How do I become a Citizen?

Fill out our [census form](https://census.eisvana.com/form.html). You will be notified once your census entry has been created.

## I am a Citizen. What now?

The best thing to do is to get more involved in the community. Eisvana mostly focusses on exploration and base building. Join a department and learn wiki documentation, taxi people to our space as a Vana Van, fly through space and take breathtaking screenshots to fill our Discord channels, expand our lore, or just talk to others on the Discord. It's up to you what you want to do, there is no clear path. Most important is that you have fun!

### Participation and Community Projects

Eisvana should be a place where you can grow and unleash your potential. We are very open to new ideas and you'll be supported in all your endeavours!

Our Discord server has a dedicated **#participation-board** channel for suggestions and community projects. Anyone can participate there. We are open to all kinds of suggestions, be it new colonies, events, structural changes for the civ, etc. It is also strongly encouraged to get directly involved, for example by spearheading a new colony or organising an event!

Community building projects are separated into the **#construction-projects** channel. Everyone can take part in these builds. If you want to do a themed group of bases, work together on one shared base, etc. feel free to post there!

### Voting

Eisvana is a semi-democratic civ. This means that most decisions may be brought to the community for discussion and vote. This may include structural changes, but also decisions like where to put the next colony.

The place to vote is the **#votes** forum channel in the Eisvana Discord. Votes usually run for 48h, but may run for longer if needed.

If you want to be notified when a new vote is opened, assign yourself the "Vote Notification" role from the roles tab in our Discord.

## Departments

Eisvana offers specialised departments to participate in.

If you want to apply for a department, or create a new one, [send a message](/services/contact) to the Bridge Crew!

### Wiki Scholars

The **Wiki Scholars** (or "Scholars" for short) are the documentation and exploration department of Eisvana. They document systems, planets, starships, fauna, etc. in our space and enter them into our wiki albums. They also add discoveries from other Eisvanians on request. If you want to have something documented in our albums, you can use the [Eisvana Album Entry Tool](https://eisvana.github.io/Eisvana-Album-Entry/) to submit it directly to the Scholars!

We will also teach you how to edit the wiki, no prior knowledge required!

### Builder Collective

The **Eisvana Builder Collective** (or "EBC" for short) is responsible for all of Eisvana's building endeavours and colonies. The EBC team is made up of builders ranging from enthusiasts to master builders. Eisvana colonies are a collaborative effort. Each builder in the "Collective" contributes their individual creativity and imagination around a shared conceptual framework.

Everyone is welcome, you don't have to be a master builder!

## Organisational Structure

Eisvana was created by a group of people. Therefore it doesn't make much sense to put a single person at the top and let them have all the power over something the community has created.

### The Community

As noted above, a lot of broad decisions are done by voting, so these important decisions are backed by the community.

### Managers

Managers oversee a small part of Eisvana's departments or other structures of the civ and report directly to the Bridge Crew. Any citizen can [apply](/services/contact) for this rank. The only requirement is that you have been an active citizen for at least **three months**. If multiple people are interested in the same position, a new department may be created. Manager roles can be created as needed, there is no fixed set of roles. So if you have an idea for a manager role and want to take on the task, let the Bridge Crew know!

### Bridge Crew

The Bridge Crew is Eisvana's Senior Leadership team. Each member of the Bridge Crew oversees at least one bigger part of the civilization or its administration. All members of the Bridge Crew carry equal weight in internal discussions, and their vote has the same power as the ones of regular citizens. The Director role only serves as head of state to the outside world.
