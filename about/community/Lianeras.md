## About Me

Hello!!!
I have been playing NMS for roughly 4 years now, and have spent the majority of that time learning how to glitch build.
Im very much behind on the new gameplay, I still havent met an autophage and I have no idea what a dreadnought looks like. Im like a hermit on my building planets, I only look up when I need something!



## Gameplay Interests

I build spaceships and other various bits and bobs from popular sci fi and fantasy tv/films, and I really enjoy bringing those things into a space where folks can interact with them.
So far I've built several star trek ships, I led a project to reimagine the Thunderbirds and I have several builds in the pipeline.

I have a half built Jaeger called Pacific Jim that haunts me.

## Departments

I am a member of the Eisvana Building Collective.
