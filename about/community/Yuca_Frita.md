## About Me

Hi! I'm an Eisvana citizen from start, being one of its founders. I'm fond of ship hunting (and multitools to some extent), and I have the honor to be qualified by the special adjective "exoticaholic" meaning I am completely crazy about this kind of ships. I have documented a full region of exotics, you can find well over 500 of my entries in the wiki in all civilizations I have contributed to.
I do love the chilled rythm of the game, been playing since 2020, and at the time of writing my Steam says I have put 4891.5h of my life into it... insane.
Beside this I am an old gamer, French. My first console was the Atari 2600 with its lovely joysticks. Asteroids and ships in an infinite procedurally generated universe already...
I have lived in 4 continents and love the international, tolerant, multi-cultured and multi-talented vibe of Eisvana.
Last detail, I have been lucky enough to be selected for naming our civilization, picking our place in the galaxy, choosing our capital system and even naming our capital planet! So you guess it, I can be competitive at times, but always friendly, I hope!

## Gameplay Interests

Ship hunting! And documenting on the wiki.
I also like to explore the systems and planets of our 7 regions. I never leave the civilization, there's so much to do inside already so staying in a known space feels safe to me. I tag the systems, planets and other discoveries as I go, I enjoy finding ALL fauna, and register my findings in our beloved spreadsheet. Special fauna gets checked for size records and my favorite ones get into the wiki.

## Departments

I am head of Ship Hunters which include multitool hunting as well.
I am member of the Eisvana Scholars
