# Create User Page

You can create your own user page here to be listed on the [community page](./).

If you only fill out the three required inputs, you will only get the card on the community page. For a full page, the textboxes should be filled out as well.

The textboxes support Markdown.

::: info
You must be a citizen of Eisvana in order to be listed.

## Editing an Existing Page

Unfortunately, you cannot easily edit an existing page from here. However, all posts are stored on GitHub and can be edited there.

A direct link to the file is at the bottom of each page.

## Form

<PlayerPageForm />
