## About Me

Hi, I'm Lenni.

I'm one of Eisvana's founding members and its political and wiki head.

I'm also known in the NMS community for being a wiki admin of the English and German NMS wiki, modder and dataminer, server owner of the German NMS community's Discord (although I still have no idea how that happened) and for writing a bunch of web apps related to NMS.

## Gameplay Interests

_Back in the day_ I did a lot of documentation. This means I documented the things I found on the wiki. This included systems, planets, fauna, starships, MTs, etc.

Nowadays, I don't play the game as much anymore, because I have a lot of other "jobs" in the NMS universe. For example I am a wiki admin. As such, I spend most of my time on the wiki, patrolling new edits.

I also discovered my love for programming through the wiki. I built a wiki page creator, which can generate wiki code from a few inputs, simplifying the process. From this learning experience, I went on to build other web apps and websites, such as this one.

With my NMS modding experience, I also built some datamining and save editing web apps.

When I actually play the game (meaning I am not testing mods or verifying stuff for the wiki), I try to learn all the languages, level up my frigates, gain standing with the various factions, or just do missions and hunt pirates.

## Departments

I'm the Head Scholar, and also have the Director position in the Bridge Crew. This means I handle all of our political stuff, as well as our wiki.

I also maintain all of our web apps and other technical areas, such as the Discord server.
