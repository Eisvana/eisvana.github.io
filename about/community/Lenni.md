# Lenni

## About Me
Hi, I'm Lenni. I do a lot of coding and a lot of wiki.

## Gameplay Interests
I do documentation. That means I take tons of screenshots and upload them to the wiki.

## Medals
None, because they don't exist yet hehe

## Departments
I'm the Head Scholar, and also have the Director position in the Bridge Crew. This means I handle all of our political stuff, as well as our wiki.
